Modeling Info tab: You should explain these three modeling approaches, the benefits of each,
and the drawbacks of each. You should include some type of math type in the explanation
(youâ€™ll need to include mathJax).

*Generalized Linear Regression Model*


tags$hr()
*Classification Trees* partitions a data set of observations into smaller and smaller homogeneous subsets. At each step (or question), a subset is split into those smaller subsets based on a single variable (or feature).  AFter the tree is constructed, it can be used to classify new observations.


The pro for using classification trees are there ease of use, easy to explain and visualize.

The con for using classification trees is there lack of predictive accuracy. By combining this method if other algorithms the accuracy can be improved.  However,  in general the predictive accuracy is limited. The other con is classification trees can have high variance.

*Random Forest* is a variation of bagging that is used for classification of regression trees,

p("\\(\\frac{\\Gamma(\\alpha+\\beta)}{\\Gamma(\\alpha)\\Gamma(\\beta)}\\theta^{\\alpha-1}(1-\\theta)^{\\beta-1}\\)")

h5("\\(\\alpha\\) Value (> 0)")
